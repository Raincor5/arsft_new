# Tactical Airsoft Map - Detailed Requirements

## Architecture

### Overall System Architecture
- **Client-Server Model**: Authoritative server with thin clients
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket-based bidirectional communication
- **State Management**: Server-side state with delta compression for updates

### iOS Client Architecture
- **Design Pattern**: MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
- **Core Components**:
  - **UI Layer**: SwiftUI/UIKit for interface components
  - **Service Layer**: Network services, location services, sensor interfaces
  - **ViewModel Layer**: State transformation, business logic
  - **Model Layer**: Data models mirroring server state

### Server Architecture
- **Design Pattern**: Event-driven architecture
- **Core Components**:
  - **Connection Manager**: Handles client connections/disconnections
  - **Session Manager**: Manages game sessions and persistence
  - **State Manager**: Maintains authoritative game state
  - **Delta Engine**: Computes and broadcasts state deltas
  - **Team Manager**: Handles team-based data segregation
  - **Authentication Service**: Validates client connections

### Data Flow
1. Client sends position/action updates to server
2. Server validates updates and modifies game state
3. Server computes deltas from previous state
4. Server broadcasts appropriate deltas to team members
5. Clients apply deltas to local state representation
6. Clients render updated state

### Communication Protocol
- **WebSocket Transport**: TCP-based persistent connections
- **Message Format**: JSON or Protocol Buffers
- **Message Types**:
  - Authentication
  - Position updates
  - Team communications
  - System alerts
  - Session management
  - State snapshots/deltas
